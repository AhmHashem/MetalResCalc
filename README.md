# MetalResCalc
Description:

This SKILL script inspects selected metal shapes in Cadence Virtuoso, extracting their width, length, and area. 
It organizes shapes by metal layer and reports shape counts, dimensions, and total areaâ€”making it well-suited for layout audits and checking metal utilization efficiency.

How to Use:

Download the file into your directory. 
Update the script with the correct metal resistivity values from your PDK documentation. 
In the CIW, run the following commands: 
- loadi("/path/to/listNetsFromSelection.il")
- Select the desired metal shapes as shown in figure 1
- Call listNetsFromSelection()
Results will be printed in your CIW window as shown in figure 2
